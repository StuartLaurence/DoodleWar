Turn based casual game.

DoodleWar
Turn-based casual physics game, inspired by the kind of chaotic fun you’d doodle in the margins of your elementary school notebook.

About the Game
DoodleWar is based on a paper-and-pencil game I used to play in elementary school. It’s a fast, silly, turn-based battle between hand-drawn units like cannons, archers, foot soldiers, and more—each with their own attacks, physics-based projectiles, and personalities.

How It Was Made
This game was created through a collaboration between myself and ChatGPT-4o. I don’t know how to code at all—but I described how I wanted the game to work, and GPT wrote the code for me. I copied the code into .js and .html files, tested things, gave feedback, and repeated the process.

It’s a great example of what a human and an AI can build together—no programming knowledge required, just creativity, curiosity, and a lot of back-and-forth.
